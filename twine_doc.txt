__KILLBOX_TWINE_DOCUMENTATION

Killbox uses a Twine [http://twinery.org/] story as the script for the Player1 experience. An offline pre-process is run on the Twine .html output file to generate a list of commands to be executed by the Player1 console at run-time. The commands for outputing text are generated automatically and the other commands are manually specified by marking up the Twine story with custom tags As a result the writer themselves can embed basic functionality inside the script.

The tags are prefixed by "KIL" followed by a bracketed/comma-seperated list of parameters.

	KIL(wait, 5.0)

Each tag is specified on it's own separate line and is removed from the output text by the pre-processor. It is an error to have multiple tags [or a tag followed/preceded by regular text] on the same line.

	KIL(wait, 5.0) KIL(log_in) <- ERROR
	Logging in... KIL(wait, 5.0) <- ERROR
